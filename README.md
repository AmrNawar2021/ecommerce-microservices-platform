# E-Commerce Microservices Platform

## üì¶ Overview

This project is a **real-world e-commerce backend** built using a microservices architecture. It demonstrates clean design, separation of concerns, role-based access control, and inter-service communication using REST and Kafka.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
[User Service] <--> [Order Service] <--> [Product Service]
       |                                      |
       v                                      v
   PostgreSQL                             PostgreSQL
       |                                      |
       ------------------> Kafka <-------------
```

Each service runs in its own Docker container and communicates over a shared Docker network.

## üß† Core Features

### User Service

* Register and login users
* Assign roles: `ROLE_ADMIN`, `ROLE_SELLER`, `ROLE_USER`
* JWT generation and validation

### Product Service

* Add, update, delete, and fetch products
* Product data protected by roles

### Order Service

* Create, update, delete, and retrieve orders
* Role-based order access:

  * `ROLE_USER` can manage only their orders
  * `ROLE_SELLER` can view all orders
  * `ROLE_ADMIN` has full access
* Integrates with Product Service to validate product stock

## üîê JWT Role Permissions

| Endpoint                  | USER | SELLER | ADMIN |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| `POST /api/orders`        | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ     |
| `GET /api/orders`         | ‚ùå    | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ     |
| `GET /api/orders/{id}`    | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ     |
| `PUT /api/orders/{id}`    | ‚ùå    | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ     |
| `DELETE /api/orders/{id}` | ‚ùå    | ‚ùå      | ‚úÖ     |

> Note: `ROLE_USER` can only access their own orders.
